# Cloning the repo

After cloning, you must add two new files to the repository:
'.env.development' & 'env.test'

The contents of each file will be:
.env.development: PGDATABASE=nc_games
.env.test: PGDATABASE=nc_games_test

This is to ensure that you can create and access the two databases locally.
